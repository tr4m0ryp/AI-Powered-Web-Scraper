# Ai-Powered-Web-Scraper - GPT-Neo Model SUCKS, soon own pre-train AI model

A Python script to generate and execute code based on user instructions using Hugging Face's GPT-Neo model. This tool can be particularly useful for dynamically creating web scraping scripts and automating repetitive coding tasks.

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- requests
- BeautifulSoup4
- pandas
- transformers
- torch
- logging

## Installation

1. Clone this repository:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/yourusername/dynamic-code-generator.git
    cd dynamic-code-generator
    ```

2. Install the required packages:
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

## Usage

1. Start the script:
    ```bash
    python generate_and_execute.py
    ```

2. Enter your instructions when prompted:
    - The script will use the instructions to generate Python code for a web scraping task.
    - The generated code will be executed automatically.

3. The generated code and execution results will be logged.

## Explanation

This script leverages a pre-trained model from Hugging Face to generate Python code based on natural language instructions. It is particularly useful in scenarios where you need to automate the creation of scripts for web scraping or other tasks that can be described textually. By dynamically generating code, it reduces the need for manual coding and accelerates the development process.
